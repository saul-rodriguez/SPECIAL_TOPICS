====== SETUP DIRECTORY ======
Created onsdag 01 april 2020

Note that some of the paths in this tutorial may point to older PDK files. Make sure you are using the very latest files!

==== 1) Create a directory structure ====

 Under the [design_name] directory, create the following directory structure.

//[design_name]//
	//init.sh (this is a script that sets environment variables for tools and licenses)//
	//src     (In this directory, place the verilog source files that will be synthetized)//
	//genus  (This is the run directory for synthesis)//
	//virtuoso (This is a virtuoso working directory. A library that will hold the p&R design needs to be created and attached to a technology file (see below ))   //
	//innovus (This is the run directory for P&R)//
		//captables (This is a symbolic link to the directory containing the RC tables that are used for timing P&R)//
	//liberty//
		//This is a placeholder for the liberty timing files that will be used during the process//
	//sim_rtl (pre-synthesis simulation of the rtl code)//
	//sim_gate (post-synthesis simulation at gate level)//
	//sim_postlay (post_layout simulation including layout delays)//


==== 1.1) Setting up virtuoso directory ====

//cd [design_name]//

Load the design tools and license:

//source init.sh//

//cd virtuoso//

//xkit -t xh018//

Select 5 thin metal + 1 thick top metak. Virtuoso will open. Create a library for your design (i.e. USART) and attach it to the technology TECH_XH018_HD. 
Close virtuoso and return to the design directory.

//cd ..//

//cd innovus//

create a cds.lib file that points to the cds.lib file in the virtuoso directory:

//nano cds.lib//

copy the following line, save and exit (ctr+o, ctrl+x)

//INCLUDE ../virtuoso/cds.lib//

Finally, return to the design directory

cd ..

==== 1.2) Create symbolic links to liberty files ====
Enter to the liberty directory and create symlinks to the liberty directories.

cd liberty

ln -s [[/pkg/xfab/XKIT/xh018/diglibs/IO_CELLS_C1V8/v1_1/liberty_LPMOS/v1_1_0/PVT_1_80V_1_80V_range/]] .
ln -s  [[/pkg/xfab/XKIT/xh018/diglibs/D_CELLS_HD/v3_0/liberty_LPMOS/v3_0_1/PVT_1_80V_range/]] .

cd ..

==== 1.3) Create symbolic link to the captables ====

cd innovus
ln -s [[/pkg/xfab/XKIT/xh018/cadence/v8_0/capTbl/v8_0_1]] captables

cd ..

==== 1.4) Copy or create symbolic links to source verilog code ====

cd src

cp [[/path.../usart.v]] .
