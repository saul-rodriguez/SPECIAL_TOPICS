====== VIRTUOSO ======
Created sÃ¶ndag 05 april 2020

====== 1) Schematic ======

go to the CIW window and select File->Import Verilog
Change the target library to the library where you have imported the P&R layout.
Add the reference libraries used in your design separated by a space (in this case it was only D_CELLS_HD). 
The "Verilog Files to import" field must point to the Verilog file created by innovus.

Inspect the schematic, it includes gates and decoupling capacitors:

====== 2) Layout ======

Open the P&R layout in virtuoso and go to Tools -> Remaster Instances...

Now create lables for the pins. Go to Xkit Utils -> pin2label
Check in the CIW that the labels were succesfuly created

Run DRC with Assura. The design should not have errors as it was checked in innovus.

Rund LVS with Assura. Everything should work with exception of power nets: innovus uses vdd and gnd nets whereas schematic uses vdd! and gnd!
 This is Ok for now. When the design is embedded in another hierarchy, the global power nets need to be renamed using net

==== APPENDIX 1 Use of Netset to override global power nets ====

The power nets that need to be renamed during AMS design are:

(standard HD and HDLL)
power_vdd
ground_gnd

(junction-isolated JIHD)
power_vddi
ground_gndi

Click on a digital instance block that was imported from innovus and edit its properties (click Q)

Then click Add. In name, write the power property name. In Type, select "netSet". In value, the new net name (coming from a pin for instance):

Now in the layout place the new power pins over the vdd and gnd trunks and run a LVS:
